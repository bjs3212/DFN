- DFN stands for ‘DoFitNow,’ a software tool designed for simulating and fitting optical data, including transmittance and reflectance.
- It allows users to adjust parameters and fit them to experimental data.



## How to use
- The X-axis of the graph is fixed to the Wavenumber unit (cm⁻¹). In future updates, you will be able to choose other units (e.g., Energy (eV), Wavelength (nm), etc.).
- Therefore, all input data must be in Wavenumber (cm⁻¹).
- Additionally, all parameter units are also in Wavenumber (cm⁻¹).

- You can adjust parameters with slider, or Shift + Mouse wheel.
- Adjust graph region with Mouse wheel, or with Mouse right button + drag.
- You can move graph region with Mouse dragging.
- You can load data or simulation with double-click in graph region. color/thickness setting is not supported now.

- You can load data by clicking the Load File button located at the top-left corner of the screen.
- Next, you need to select the type of data (e.g., R, T, etc.).
- Once loaded, the data will be displayed on the graph.

- You can fit the simulation to the data.
- Click the Add button next to the Fit Item List.
- Then, select the data and choose either a sample or a layer. The sample simulates R and T, while the layer simulates S1, S2, E1, E2, etc.
- After that, click the Fit button.
- If the simulation is loaded on the graph, you can see the changes in real time.
